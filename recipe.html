<h1 id="title">World's Tastiest Breakfast Sandwich!</h1></br>
<p>Years before your regular brunch spot started serving its version, the breakfast sandwich was a utilitarian, on-the-go meal for factory workers in 19th century London. On their way to the daily grind, downtrodden workers would speedily chug a cup of coffee at a street vendor's stand, then grab a breakfast sandwich to eat as they made their way to the factory. They were originally called "bap" sandwiches, named for the soft rolls used to hold the egg and meat filling. Sometimes bacon or sausage were the main meat component, but a simple slathering of sausage grease wasn't uncommon.</p>
<p> As the industrial revolution came into full swing in the USA, the breakfast sandwich made its way across the Atlantic. We even got our own version, stuffed with eggs, ham, green pepper, and onion, known as the Denver sandwich. This part of the story is where boy meets girl, or in this case, where Ryan met his favourite recipe: <b><em>The World's Tastiest Breakfast Sandwich!</em></b></p>
